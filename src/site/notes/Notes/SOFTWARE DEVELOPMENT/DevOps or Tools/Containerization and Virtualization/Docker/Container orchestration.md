#### Purpose of container orchestration
- Simplifies management of many containers
- Ensuring that multiple containers interact effectively and efficiently

##### Declarative programming in container orchestration
- Declarative programming:
	- Defining the desired output instead of describing the steps to reach it

#### Benefits of container orchestration
- Easy __scaling__ of containers
	- Horizontal scaling: Adding/Removing containers
	- Vertical scaling: In-/Decreasing computing resources of specific containers
- __Automation__ of operations
	- Time savings
	- Improved developer productivity
	- Cost savings
- Better __performance__ of application

### Applications of container orchestration
- Microservices architecture
- Application scaling
- Automation of pipelines
