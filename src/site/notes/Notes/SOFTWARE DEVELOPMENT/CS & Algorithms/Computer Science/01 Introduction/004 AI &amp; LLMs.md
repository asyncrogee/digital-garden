-   Consider how we can utilize the building blocks above to start creating our own artificial intelligence. Look at the following pseudocode:
    
    ```
    If student says hello
        Say hello back
    Else if student says goodbye
        Say goodbye back
    Else if student asks how you are
        Say you're well
    Else if student asks why 111 in binary is 7 in decimal
    ...
    ```
    
    In this way, it would take tens of thousands of line of code for every interaction.

__Large Language Models__ look at patterns in large blocks of language online, like what is the usual answers to the question like: "Hi, How are you?" mostly the answer to this is: "I'm good, How are you?"

"Such language models attempt to create a best guess of what words come after one another or alongside one another."
