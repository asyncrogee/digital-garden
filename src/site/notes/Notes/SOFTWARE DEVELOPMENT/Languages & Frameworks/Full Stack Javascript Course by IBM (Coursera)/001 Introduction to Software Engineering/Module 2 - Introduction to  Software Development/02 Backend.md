- Creates and manages resources needed to respond to client requests
- Enables server infrastructure to process request, supply data and provide other services securely

> [!question] What does the back-end developer do?
> Back-end developers:
>
> - Processes the data you enter while browsing such as:
>   - Login information
>   - Product searches
>   - Payment information
> - Write and maintain the parts of the application that process the inputs

> [!example] Back-end developer skills
> Example of tasks and associated skills that back-end developers need:
>
> - Search requests submitted to database
>   - Understand web application development language
>   - Request database for correct data
> - Navigation to restricted areas
>   - Provide access based on user's log in status
>   - Manage, authenticate and authorize user account
> - Secure payments
>   - Secure data handling of sensitive information
>   - Secure storage of sensitive information

> [!abstract] APIs, routing, and endpoints
>
> - Request Image
> - Fill our Form
> - Input Sensitive Information
>
> All require different services from the back-end server
>
> - APIs, routes, and endpoints process requests from the front-end
>   - **API** is a **_code that works with data_**
>   - **Route** is a **\_path to a website or page\_\_**
>   - **Endpoint** can be an **_API or route_**
> - Back-end developers create routes to _direct requests to the correct service_
> - APIs provide a way for Cloud Apps to access resources from the back-end

> [!example] Back-end languages and frameworks
> Some popular back-end languages are:
>
> - Javascript
>   - Node.js
>   - Express
> - Python - Django - Flask
>   > [!info] Working with databases
>   > Languages and tools for working with databases:
>   >
>   > - Structured Query Language (**SQL**)
>   > - Object-Relational Mapping (**ORM**)
