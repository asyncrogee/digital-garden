### Sequential vs Iterative

**Sequential**: Waterfall and V-shape Model

- centers around the whole product before soliciting customer's feedback

**Iterative**: Agile

- focuses on quick short burst of development

> [!tip] Waterfall method
>
> - **Sequential method** of software development where the _output of a phase_ is the **_input of the next phase_**
> - Development and work on the next phase, start only after the completion of the previous phase
> - The client doesn't see the product until it's in **testing phase**

> [!tip] V-shape model
>
> - similar to **Waterfall method** as they are both sequential
> - In the left of the V, is the Verification and on the right is Validation

> - Teams works in cycle or sprints which is about 1-4 weeks long
>   - Unit Testing happens in each sprint to minimize risk of failure
> - At the end of each sprint, the demo is presented in a meeting for client to see functionality and provide feedback
