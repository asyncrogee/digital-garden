> [!info] Steps to gathering requirements
>
> - Identifying stakeholders

> [!tip] Identifying stakeholders
> ![[Pasted image 20241207090914.png]]

> [!tip] Establishing goals and objectives
>
> - **Goals**: broad, long-term achievable outcomes
> - **Objectives**: actionable, measurable actions that achieve the goal

> [!tip] Eliciting, documenting, confirming
>
> - **Elicit**
>   - Surveys
>   - Questionnaires
>   - Interviews
> - **Document**
>   - Align with goals and objectives
>   - Easily understood
> - **Confirm**
>   - Consistency
>   - Clarity
>   - Completeness

> [!tip] Prioritizing
> Labels:
>
> - Must-have
> - Highly desired
> - Nice to have

> [!info] ###### Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
>
> - Captures functionalities the software should perform
> - Establishes benchmarks / service-levels for performance
> - Purpose and scope
> - Constraints, assumptions, dependencies
> - **Requirements**
>   - Functional
>   - External interface
>   - System features
>   - Non-functional
>
> > [!tip] Purpose and Scope
> >
> > - **Purpose**
> >   - Who has access to the SRS
> >   - How it should be used
> > - **Scope**
> >   - Software benefits
> >   - Goals
> >   - Objectives
>
> > [!tip] Constraints, assumptions, dependencies
> >
> > - **Constraints**: how the software must operate under given conditions
> > - **Assumptions**: required OS or hardware
> > - **Dependencies**: on other software products
>
> > [!tip] Requirements
> >
> > - **Functional**: functions of the software
> > - **External**: users and interactions with other hardware or software
> > - **System features**: functions of the system
> > - **Non-functional**: performance, safety, security, quality

> [!info] ###### User Requirements Specification (URS)
>
> - Describe business need and end-user expectations
>
> - **User stories:**
>
>   - Who is the user?
>   - What is the function that needs to be performed?
>   - Why does the user want this functionality?
>
> - Confirmed during user acceptance testing
> - Often combined into the SRS

> [!info] ###### System Requirements Specification (SysRS)
>
> - Outlines **requirements of the system**
> - Broader than an SRS
>
> - Contains:
>   - System capabilities
>   - Interfaces and user characteristics
>   - Policy
>   - Regulation
>   - Personnel
>   - Performance
>   - Security
>   - System acceptance criteria
