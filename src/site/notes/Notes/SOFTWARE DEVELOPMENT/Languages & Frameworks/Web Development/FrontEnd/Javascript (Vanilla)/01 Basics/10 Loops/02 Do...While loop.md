# 02 Do...While loop

---

Syntax:

```javascript
do {
  // loop body
} while (condition);
```

- Execute the body first / once
- Check the condition, while it's true/truthy
- Execute it again and again

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  alert(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 3);
```

> [!tip]
> Should only be used when you want the body to execute **at least once** regardless of the condition being true / truthy

---

### More Examples:

```javascript
let num;

do {
  num = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100?", 0);
} while (num <= 100 && num);
```

- check for `num <= 100`, if entered value is still not greater than `100`
- `&& num` is false when `num` is `null` or _empty string_.
  - Then `while` loop stops too.
- If `num` is `null` then `num <= 100` is `true`
  - without 2nd check the loop wouldn't stop if the user clicks **CANCEL**.
    - Both checks are required.
