# 09 Bitwise Operators

---

Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.

These operators are not JavaScript-specific. They are supported in most programming languages.

The list of operators:

- AND ( `&` )
- OR ( `|` )
- XOR ( `^` )
- NOT ( `~` )
- LEFT SHIFT ( `<<` )
- RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>` )
- ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>>` )
