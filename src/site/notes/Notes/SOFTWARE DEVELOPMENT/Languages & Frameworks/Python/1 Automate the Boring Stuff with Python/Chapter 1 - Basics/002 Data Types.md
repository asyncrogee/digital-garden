Raw numbers from Negative(example: `-9`) to Positive (example: `9`) are ***INTEGERS***, Numbers with a point(example: `1.25`) are called ***FLOATING-POINT numbers***.


### Strings
***STRINGS*** are the characters that is inside **`Single Quotations`**(example: `'This is a string'`). 
You can have a string with no characters in it (example: `' '`), It's called an ***Empty String*** or Blank String
