# More strings and lists

You are already familiar with the ___[]___ syntax for accessing a part of a string:

```python
my_string = "exemplary"
print(my_string[3:7])
```

The same syntax works with lists. 
Lists can be sliced just like strings:

```python
my_list = [3,4,2,4,6,1,2,4,2]
print(my_list[3:7])
```
