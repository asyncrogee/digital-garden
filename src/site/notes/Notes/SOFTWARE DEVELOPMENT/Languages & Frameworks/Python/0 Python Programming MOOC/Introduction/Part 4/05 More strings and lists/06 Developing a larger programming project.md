# Developing a larger programming project

>Rule No. 1 in tackling any programming project is not trying to solve everything at once. The program should be built out of smaller sections, such as helper functions. You should verify the operation of each part before moving on to the next. If you try to handle too much at once, most likely only chaos ensues.

To do this you will need a way of testing your functions outside the main function. You can achieve this by defining a main function explicitly, and calling this function from outside any other function in the program. A single function call is then easy to comment out for testing. The first steps in building the following programming project could look like this:

```python
def main():
    points = []
    # your program code goes here

main()
```

Now the helper functions can be tested without running the main function:

```python
# helper function for determining the grade based on the amount of points
def grade(points):
    # more code

def main():
    all_points = []
    # your program code goes here

# comment out the main function
#main()

# test the helper function
student_points = 35
result = grade(student_points)
print(result)
```
