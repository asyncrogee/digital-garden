#### Scale:
- __Unit tests__: testing individual classes / functions
- __Integration tests__: testing packages / subsystems
- __System tests__: testing the entire system
	- In web & service world, the concept of "system" is fluid

#### Process: 
- Test first: test-driven development (TDD)
	- Write the tests __before the code__
	- Write code to pass the tests
- Test after
	- Check whether existing code passes tests
	- Even TDD is "test after" most of the time (refactoring)
- Iteration
	- Either way, you will spend most of your time re-testing

#### Purpose:
- Functional Testing
- Performance Testing
- Security Testing
- Usability Testing
- Availability Testing
