To make sure software performs as expected:

### Verification and Validation

__VERIFICATION__:
- "Are we building the product right?"
- The software should conform to its specification

__VALIDATION__:
- "Are we building the right product?"
- The software should do what the user really requires

> GOAL: Assure the software meets user's needs

> [!tip] Techniques for getting software "Right"
> - Need to __understand__ and __validate__ software requirements
> - Need to apply multiple __V&V__ techniques throughout the development cycle
> 	- Inspections
> 	- Design discussions
> 	- Static analysis
> 	- Testing
> 	- Runtime verification
