> [!abstract] Normal Flow
>
> - Default positioning
> - Elements is "**in flow**"
> - Elements are simply laid out according to their order in HTML Code
>   Default positioning
>
> ```css
> position: relative;

> [!abstract] Absolute Positioning
>
> - Element is removed from the normal flow: "**_out of flow_**"
> - No impact on surrounding elements, might **overlap** them
> - we use Top, Bottom, Left, or Right to offset the element from its **relatively positioned container**
>
> ```css
> position: absolute;
