- Software versions are **identified by version numbers**
- Version numbers indicate:
  - When the software was released
  - When it was updated
  - If any minor changes or fixes were made to the software
- Software developers use versioning to keep track of new software, updates, and patches

> [!info] Version numbers
>
> - Version numbers can be short or long, with 2, 3, or 4 sets
> - Each number set is divided by a period
> - An application with a 1.0 version number indicates the first release
> - Software with many releases and updates will have a larger number
> - Some use dates for versioning, such as Ubuntu Linux version 18.04.2 released in 2018 April, with a change shown in the third number set
