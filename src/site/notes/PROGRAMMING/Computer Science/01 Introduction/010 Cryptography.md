-  Cryptography is the art of ciphering and deciphering a message.
- `plaintext` and a `key` are provided to a `cipher`, resulting in ciphered text.

- The key is a special argument passed to the cipher along with the plaintext. 
- The cipher uses the key to make decisions about how to implement its cipher algorithm.
